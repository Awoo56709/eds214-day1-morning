## Exceeds Spec

#### The code is appropriately commented

Function descriptions are present in their corresponding .R files and contain default values and an example of their potential use to increase customization of analysis. Assumptions and disclaimers about these defaults are included in the README

####  The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works
The README includes a zoom-able chart of the workflow as well as a brief overview of the analysis

## Collaboration
1. I had a lot of fun with the peer collaboration. In class, I reviewed Megan's repo, for each spec, I left bullet points containing the things I thought could be improved, added, or done differently. I made sure to give specifics about multiple ways forward, including details about what I did, or other methods I thought would work well with the workflow she had.
