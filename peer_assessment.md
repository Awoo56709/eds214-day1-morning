# Automate

## Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document
- meets specs. The analysis renders beautifully and quickly.

## The analysis runs without errors
- meets specs: No errors, clean. One of the best ive seen. Visuals are spot on.

## The analysis produces the expected output
- meets specs: The render was clean and thorough. Links to the cleaned data methods were not functional maybe will be added later?

## Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)
- Meets specs: the spagets were in three tiers. Very organized and liked the transition to more advanced code.



# Organize

## Raw data is contained in its own folder
- Meets specs: both raw and cleaned data in different folders but depends on convention and personal preference

## Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data
- meets specs: Again, very organized for file queries and provides visuals and docs for the intermediate outputs.

## At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file
- Meets specs:


Document

## The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs
- not yet: the readme provided ample information about its contents as well as the links to the files that housed the materials in question

# The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works
- not yet: the readme had a link to the flowchart however did not have an existing flowchart.


# The code is appropriately commented
- meets specs: there is ample code comments for every significant line. Made reading and referencing the code digestable for those with less experience

# Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention
- meets specs: conventions were followed, usually lowercase however a few were in all caps (i.e BQ1)


# Scale

###After cloning the repo on Workbench:

## Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages
- meets specs: through this documents the needed libraries are within the files or rather provides an init for this purpose. 

- The analysis script runs without errors
